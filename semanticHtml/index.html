      <h2>"Peter Parker" and "Spidey"</h2>

      <p>
        Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
        Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko,
        he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15
        (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been
        featured in movies, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man
        is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle
        Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a
        plane crash.

        Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence
        and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as
        Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson and Harry Osborn, romantic interests
        Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson and the Black Cat, and foes such as Doctor
        Octopus, the Green Goblin and Venom. In his origin story, he gets
        spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these
        include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and
        detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted
        "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider webs of his own
        design.

      <h2>first time appearing</h2>

      <p>
        When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in
        superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to
        the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter
        Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's
        secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and
        loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen
        heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like
        Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that "with
        great power there must also come great responsibility"â€”a line included
        in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later
        retroactively attributed to his guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.

        Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977. In films, Spider-Man
